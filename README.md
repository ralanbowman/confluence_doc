# Confluence Install Doc

A member of a technical writer mailing list Iâ€™m on wanted to install [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence "Confluence") to evaluate it as a solution for their customer-facing documentation. They had access to a virtual server, but were stumbling somewhat with the official [Confluence install instructions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/conf57/installing-confluence-on-linux-701435875.html) (Note - they were installing Confluence 5.7, which was the most current version at the time). Having installed Confluence a number of times while I was evaluating it myself, I created an install guide they could use to get started. 

**My install guide is here: [Confluence Install Guide](docs/confluence_install.md)**
